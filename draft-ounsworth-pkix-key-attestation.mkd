--- abstract

This document describes syntax for conveying key origin attestation information to a Certification Authority (CA) or other entity,
so that they may decide how much trust to place in the management private of the key,
for example to support a decision about whether to issue a certificate.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Key attestion refers to the originator of a cryptographic key pair providing information about the provenance of that key pair,
in a manner that can be cryptographically verified.
The information provided may include, for example, the model and identity of the device that created the key pair
and any policies that may be enforced upon the use of the private key.

This information can be used by a Certification Authority to decide whether to issue a certificate,
or by other entities for their own purposes.

Many devices, including Hardware Security Modules, provide attestation information of some form in proprietary formats.
A common syntax for key attestations is required to reduce the implementation burden on CA implementors and operators.
Furthermore it is desirable that the syntax is sympathetic to existing CA implementations.

# Cryptographic Keys

This section describes the cryptographic keys referenced in this document.

## Trust Anchor Key

A trust anchor key is a signing key held by a vendor.
It is used either to sign devices directly or to sign intermediate CA keys.
It may  be used to sign intermediate CAs or it may be used to sign devices directly.

Constraints:

- A trust anchor key MUST NOT be used for any purpose other than signing intermediate CA keys or devices.

## Intermediate CA Key

An intermediate CA key is a signing key held by a vendor and certified by that vendor's trust anchor.
It is used either to sign devices directly or to sign further intermediate CA keys.
Like a trust anchor key, it may only used to sign intermediate CAs or it may be used to sign devices directly.

The exact configuration and management of trust anchor keys and intermediate CA keys is beyond the scope of this document.
An example configuration is that a vendor have an offline trust anchor,
and an intermediate CA in each of its manufacturing sites,
certified by the trust anchor key when a manufacturing site is created or during maintenance or recovery activities.

Constraints:

- An intermediate CA key MUST NOT be used for any purpose other than signing intermediate CA keys or devices.

## Device Identity Key

A device identity key is a signing key held by a device.
It is used either to sign key attestations directly or to certify device certification subkeys.
It is envisaged that this key will persist for the lifetime of the device.

Constraints:

- A device identity key MUST NOT be used for any purpose other than signing key attestation certificates or device delegation certificates.

## Device Certification Subkey

A device certification key is a signing key held by a device.
It is used either to sign key attestations directly or to certify further device certification subkeys.
Device certification keys may have any lifetime, from single use to the lifetime of the device.

Constraints:

- A device certification subkey MUST NOT be used for any purpose other than signing key attestation certificates or device delegation certificates.

## Application Key


An application key is a key created and managed by a device.
Its purpose and lifetime are arbitrary.

# Key Attestations

A key attestation consists of a nonempty sequence of [RFC5280] certificates.
There is are ordering constraints on the sequence of certificates, described below as requirements on a verifier.


The first certificate is signed by a trust anchor key.
A CA (or any other entity which wishes to verify the key attestation) must decide 
through its own policies and processes which trust anchors keys to trust
and what policies to accept in key attestations certified by them.
A trust anchor key MUST be associated with a vendor identity.

Constraints:

- A verifier MUST verify that each certificate is well-formed
- A verifier MUST verify that the first certificate is signed by a trust anchor key
- A verifier MUST verify that each certificate, apart from the first, is certified by the previous certificate in the key attestation.

The certificate types that may appear in a key attestation are described in the following sections.

## Intermediate CA Certificate


An intermediate CA delegation certificate certifies an intermediate CA.
It MUST have the [RFC5280] basic constraints extension with the `cA` boolean set to true.
It MUST NOT have any of the extensions defined below.

Constraints:

- A verifier may detected an intermediate CA delegation by the absence of the extensions defined below.
- There may be any number of intermediate CA certificates, including 0.

## Device Identity Certificate

A device identity certificate certifies a specific device,
in the form of a binding between its identity and a public device identity key.
It MUST have the [RFC5280] basic constraints extension with the `cA` boolean set to true
(since the device is acting as a CA).

A device identity certificate MUST contain a `DeviceInformation` extension,
identified by `id-device-information`.
This contains the vendor identity, device model and device serial.
Together these uniquely define a particular device.

For a hardware device, it is envisaged that a manufacturing facility will sign a device identity certificate for each device as it is manufactured,
binding a vendor-specific representation of device identity such as a serial number to the device's unique long-term key pair.

No significance is attached to the subject field of a device identity certificate.

Constraints:

- A verifier MUST reject any key attestation that does not contain exactly one device identity certificate.
- A verifier MUST reject any key attestation whose device identity certificate appears before an intermediate CA delegation.
- A verifier MUST reject any device identity certificate whose vendor identity does not match the one associated with the trust anchor used to verify the key attestation.
- Two distinct devices from the same vendor MUST NOT have the same device identity.
- Two distinct devices MUST NOT have the same device identity key.

## Device Delegation Certificate

A device delegation certificate certifies that a certification subkey that belongs to a specific device.
It MUST have the [RFC5280] basic constraints extension with the `cA` boolean set to true
(since the device is acting as a CA).

A device delegation certificate MUST contain a `DeviceSubkeyInformation` extension,
identified by `id-device-subkey-information`.
This contains the vendor identity, device model, device serial and key role.
Note that this does not uniquely define the certification subkey.

It is envisaged that single hardware device may have multiple certification subkeys.
It may create new ones over time, for instance when the device is re-initialized, 
or if the device supports multiple users it may create a distinct certification subkeys for each user.

No significance is attached to the subject field of a device delegation certificate.

Constraints:

- A verifier MUST reject any key attestation whose device identity certificate appears before the device identity certificate.
- A verifier MUST reject any device delegation certificate whose vendor identity does not match the one associated with the trust anchor used to verify the key attestation.
- There may be any number of device delegation certificates, including 0.

## Key Attestation Certificate

A key attestation certificate certifies that an application key was created in a particular device and is managed according to a particular policy.
If it contains the [RFC5280] basic constraints extension then it MUST have the `cA` boolean set to false.

A key attestation certificate MUST contain a `ApplicationKeyInformation` extension
identified by `id-application-key-information`.
This contains the vendor identity, device model, device serial, key use policy (see {{sec-key-use-policies}}) and vendor-specific information.

No significance is attached to the subject field of a key attestation certificate.

Constraints:

- A verifier MUST reject any key attestation that does not contain exactly one key attestation certificate.
- A verifier MUST reject any key attestation whose key attestation certificate appears before any other kind of certificate.
- A verifier MUST reject any key attestation certificate whose vendor identity does not match the one associated with the trust anchor used to verify the key attestation.
- A verifier MUST reject any key attestation certificate whose policy is not in their list of acceptable policies.

### Vendor-Specific Information

This field of the key attestation certificate may contain any octet string (including the empty string).
The interpretation is up to the vendor.
For example,
it may be used to convey information about how the key was generated
or a vendor-specific description of the policies that govern its use.

# Key Use Policies {#sec-key-use-policies}

Key attestation certificates contain object identifiers describing the policies that the device will enforce upon use of the application key.
For example `id-policy-signature-only` indicates that the key may only be used to make signatures
(and not to decrypt, as would be possible for an RSA key).

Note that these are unrelated to the certificate policy OIDs defined in [RFC5280] section 4.2.1.4.

## Key Use Policy Variants

Each of the policies described below has two variants.

1. In the first, the policy means that a key may be used only in certain ways,
and this cannot be overidden even by an administrator.

2. In the second, the policy means that a key may normally be used only in certain ways,
but that an authorized administrator may override this in some way
(for example, in order to facilitate disaster recovery).

For a CA, normally only the first variant (no administrative override) would be acceptable.
If the application key is lost then the application key owner can be expected
to generate a new key and certify it.
There is no need to recover the old key.

In other use cases, the weaker policy may be more appropriate.

## Signature-Only Policy

This policy is identified by `id-policy-signature-only`.
It means that the private key may only be used for signature, and may not be exported in plaintext outside the device.

## Signature-Only Policy with Administrator Override

This policy is identified by `TODO`.
It means that the private key may normally only be used for signature,
but that an authorized administrator may override this in some way.

## Vendor-Defined Key Use Policies

A vendor may define policies outside the list described in the list document,
for example reflecting policies not envisaged by this document
or to cover device-specific functionality.
For example they may describe a policy in terms of their device's proprietary policy or access control syntax#
and publish an OID reflecting that policy.
A verifier MUST NOT accept such a vendor-defined policy unless they fully understand the intended meaning.

# Embedding Key Attestations in Certification Requests {#sec-embedding}

A convenient way to convey a key attestation is to embed it into a [RFC2986] certification request.
This may be done via the `AttestationBundle` extension, identified by the OID `id-attestation-bundle`.

Constraints:

- A certification request SHOULD only have one embedded key attestation.
- A CA MUST follow meet all the constraints on verifiers described above.
- A CA MUST verify that the subject public key in the certification request is the same as the subject public key in the key attestation certificate.








# Implementation Considerations {#sec-imp-considers}

# IANA Considerations {#sec-iana}

... TODO document any codepoints or OIDs that we need IANA to register ...

we do have some new OIDs. I've used free ones, they can be replaced with something else of course.

<!-- End of IANA Considerations section -->


# Security Considerations

... TODO document any additional (security) GOTCHAs ...

## Key Use Constraints

The key use constraints describe above are essential.
For example if a device identity key could be used by a user to sign arbitrary messages,
that user could forge key attestations.

## Verification Model

An API that verifies a key attestion may be designed in a number of different ways.


1. It may accept just a key attestation.
It will verify it, and return either an error indicator or the public trust anchor key, vendor identity, public application key, and the policy governing is use.
The caller must check at least that the trust anchor key is acceptable; the vendor identity from the key attestation matches the one associated with the trust anchor; and that the policy is acceptable, before using the application key.
If the caller is running in a context where there are multiple copies of the application key (for example, the certification request verification described in {{sec-embedding}} it must also check that all copies of the appcalition key match.

2. It may accept a key attestation, trust anchor, vendor identity and at least one acceptable policy.
It will verify the key attestation using the trust anchor, and check that the vendor identities in the key attestation match the trust anchor, and check that the policy is acceptable.
It will return either an error indicator or the application key.
If the caller is running in a context where there are multiple copies of the application key then it must also check that all copies of the appcalition key match.
Apart from that it can use the application key without further checks.

3. It may accept a key attestation, trust anchor, vendor identity, application key and at least one acceptable policy.
It will verify the key attestation using the trust anchor, and check that the vendor identities in the key attestation match the trust anchor, check that the policy is acceptable, and that the application key is the expected value.
It will return either an error or a success indicator.
The caller can use the application key without further checks.

In all of these models the same set of checks must be done, but in the first two some of the checks are delegated to the caller.
The advantage of the later models is that they are more robust against the caller ommitting some of the necessary checks.
For a publicly available API this robustness is particularly appropriate.

## Policies with Administrator Override

No attempt is made to define the scope of administrator override in policies which include it.
Depending on the device it may mean that,
for example, a signature-only RSA key could additional be given decrypt permission,
or it could mean that private key material could be exploited in plaintext.
The range of possibilities is to broad to tie down in a device-independent specification.

It should be noted that placing trust in a key does mean generally placing trust in the operators and administrators
of the device that contains it, even without any possibilty of administrator override of the policy governing its use.
For example there is nothing in the signature-only policy to prevent a key owner exposing a signature oracle for their key,
allowing anyone to sign with it.
In other words, verifiers should not place undue weight on the distinction between the two classes of policy.
